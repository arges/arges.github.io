#### Work

I enjoy creating new works and understanding our fascinating world. I am
currently a Lead Software Engineer at Vectra Networks working on new platforms,
build infrastructure, system software, and system updates.  Previously I've
worked at Canonical as a Kernel Engineer and technical lead on the live patch
service project.  In addition, I've enjoyed music my entire life, and
continue to play with friends and in a band locally. I'm fond of anything that
makes one think critically, love reading, and being a dad.
