#### Work

I enjoy creating new works and understanding our fascinating world.
I am currently building amazing cyber-security software at [Confluera][9].
Previously I've worked at [Vectra][10] Networks as a Manager and Team
Lead working on new platforms, build infrastructure, system software, and
system updates.  Previously I’ve worked at [Canonical][11] as a Kernel Engineer and
technical lead on the live patch service project.  In addition, I’ve enjoyed
music my entire life, and continue to play with friends and in a band locally.
I’m fond of anything that makes one think critically, love reading, and being a
dad.
