#### Work

I enjoy creating new works and understanding our complex world. I am currently a
Kernel Software Engineer for Canonical helping to make Ubuntu better. Primarily
I fix bugs, and work on new code when I can. In addition, I've enjoyed music my
entire life, and continue to play with friends and in a band locally. I also
brew beer, garden, run races and read tons of books.
