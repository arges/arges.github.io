Here is a really cool car robot I built:

This post will document roughly how I put it together. If you want to build
your own you can read this guide for an outline and perhaps share or improve
the code.

# Setup Board

For my car robot I'm using a Raspberry Pi Zero since it is small and uses low
power. First go to this [link][1], download and install Raspbian Lite and
ensure you can boot into it on your Pi. Expand your filesystem and ensure you
can connect wirelesly to your board.

Next add your wireless network ssid and psk to
`/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. Like this:

```
network={
  ssid="network_name"
  psk="network_password"
}
```

Reboot and ensure it automatically connects to the wireless.

# Assemble the Hardware

For this project I used a robot car chassis which provided the motors, wheels
and base. In addition I purchased an h-bridge to drive the motors. Since this
was a prototype I was going for low cost. I also needed a set of batteries and
holder to power both the board and motors. Finally I used a Raspberry Pi Zero
to control the machine along with a wireless dongle and USB OTG cable. The
following is an approximation of my total cost, many of the items I had in the
house already.

## Bill Of Materials

| Description      | Cost USD |
| -----------------|----------|
| RaspberryPiZero  | $5       |
| RobotCarChassis  | $13      |
| DualHBridge      | $9       |
| 8xRechargeAA     | $20      |
| BatteryHolder    | $5       |
| EdimaxWireless   | $10      |
| OTGUsb           | $5       |
|                  |          |
| Total            | $67      |

After gathering everything you need to start wiring up all the components.
Securing the parts to the chassis can be done with screws or tape. Care needs
to be taken to ensure the car is well balanced and parts are secured.

## Wiring Diagram

I connected the pins as follows. You should take care to use GPIO pins that
aren't asserted on boot otherwise your car will spin in circles during boot (or
drive off the table.) In addition I connected the Raspberry Pi Zero to the same
batteries used to drive the motors. Care needs to be taken to ensure grounds
are connected and there is enough current for all devices. I would also suggest
a switch between the batteries and the h-bridge to be able to completely power
off the device easily.

| MotorBoard | RPi2 Pin | Description |
| -----------|----------|-------------|
| IN1        | 18       | GPIO24      |
| IN2        | 11       | GPIO17      |
| IN3        | 16       | GPIO23      |
| IN4        | 15       | GPIO22      |
| GND        | 9        | GND         |
| +5V        | 4        | +5V         |

# Get the software

I used golang to create the controller for the robot. In addition I wanted to
have the control via a webserver running on the robot itsself. You can clone
the project [here][2]. Once downloaded you can build on a local machine. First
ensure that golang-go is installed. Next you can build using the following
inside the cargo directory:

```
go get ./...
go build GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 car.go
```

This targets ARMv6, if you have another board you may need to set GOARM
differently.

Finally upload `car` and `control.html` to the Raspberry Pi Zero's /home/pi
directory and edit `/etc/rc.local` to run `/home/pi/car` on boot. Reboot the
machine and on another machine open a browser to http://raspberrypi:9090.
Now you should be able to control your robot! Have fun.
