After a visit to England, I had the pleasure of playing this awesome game and decided I'd like to play it back home.

After a bit of a sticker shock after seeing it on Amazon, I decided that it would be easy enough to build my own set. I enlisted the help of a friend and set out to the hardware store. &nbsp;I would recommend buying a little bit extra, but overall the materials came to around $18. I recommend having a mitre saw, circular saw, and either a good supply of sandpaper or a floor sander handy. Below is a picture of the final product. To build your own set, just read the directions below and find out what works for you.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dsQGZCFGqhE/UipHMO_NvuI/AAAAAAAADes/ThNUZHKiFbQ/s1600/kubb3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dsQGZCFGqhE/UipHMO_NvuI/AAAAAAAADes/ThNUZHKiFbQ/s1600/kubb3.jpg" height="320" width="240" /></a></div><br /><h3>References</h3><div><ol><li><a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20398029,00.html">http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20398029,00.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Kubb-Set/">http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Kubb-Set/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2011/08/diy-project-kubb-%E2%80%93-the-swedish-lawn-game.html">http://www.designsponge.com/2011/08/diy-project-kubb-%E2%80%93-the-swedish-lawn-game.html</a></li></ol></div>
