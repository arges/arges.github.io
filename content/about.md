#### Work

I enjoy creating new works and understanding our fascinating world. I currently
work at [Cloudflare][12] as an Engineering Manager. I have also worked on
cyber-security software at [Confluera][9]. In addition, I've worked at
[Vectra][10] Networks as a Manager and Team Lead working on new platforms,
build infrastructure, system software, and system updates. I’ve worked at
[Canonical][11] as a Kernel Engineer and technical lead on the live patch
service project.  I’ve enjoyed music my entire life, and continue to play with
friends and in a band locally. I’m fond of anything that makes one think
critically, love reading, and being a dad.

Opinions are my own and not the views of any employer or organization.
