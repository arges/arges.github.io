#### Personal

I enjoy learning, growing others and creating new works in our fascinating
world. I enjoy cooking, teaching and being present with my family. I’ve enjoyed
music my entire life, and continue to occasionally make new works. I believe it
is important to challenge oneself to always do better, while being grounded in
thankfulness and appreciation.

#### Work

I currently work at [Cloudflare][12] as a Senior Engineering Manager. I have
also worked on cyber-security software at a startup called [Confluera][9]. In
addition, I've worked at [Vectra][10] Networks as a Manager and Team Lead
working on new platforms, build infrastructure, system software, and system
updates. I’ve worked at [Canonical][11] as a Kernel Engineer and technical lead
on the live patch service project.
