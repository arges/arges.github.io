Here I will explain how to setup Juju for use with this environment. For this setup, weâ€™ll use the maas-server as the juju client to interact with the cluster.
This guide was very useful:
https://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/juju-quick-start.html
Update to the latest stable tools:
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt-get update
Next we want to setup juju on the host machine.</description></item><item><title>manually deploying openstack with a virtual maas on ubuntu trusty (part 1)</title><link>/posts/2014-06-13-manually-deploying-openstack-with/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 15:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2014-06-13-manually-deploying-openstack-with/</guid><description>The goal of this new few series of posts is to be able to setup virtual machines to simulate a real-world openstack deployment using maas and juju. This goes through setting up a maas-server in a VM as well as setting up maas-nodes in VMs and getting them enlisted/commissioned into the maas-server. Next juju is configured to use the maas cluster. Finally, openstack is deployed using juju. OverviewRequirementsIdeally, a large server with 16 cores, 32G memory, 500G disk.</description></item></channel></rss>
