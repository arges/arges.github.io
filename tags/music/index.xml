This keyboard does not generate sounds on its own, so it requires some other device to generate the sounds based on the MIDI output. I used my laptop running Linux to accomplish this with some minimal setup.
First you must plug the keyboard in via USB. If you launch the program and get sounds, great!</description></item></channel></rss>
