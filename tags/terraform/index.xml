For much of these we use Debian packaging and ansible. In many instances the output needs to be cloud images as well as things that can be imaged on baremetal. For this we use Packer which can drive ansible. While using ansible to describe how a system is composed is nice, we also need to describe how those systems will be deployed.</description></item></channel></rss>
