The command grub-reboot allows you to set a temporary entry to use for the next reboot; however you need to know the correct input in order for it to work.
First, look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg and determine which kernel you want to reboot into.</description></item><item><title>building ubuntu kernels with debug symbols</title><link>chrisarges.net/posts/2015-10-02-building-ubuntu-kernels-with-debug-symbols/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 08:53:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>chrisarges.net/posts/2015-10-02-building-ubuntu-kernels-with-debug-symbols/</guid><description>Occasionally it is useful to be able to build a kernel the Ubuntu way with debug symbols. The following is how to install dependencies, clone the tree, and finally build in such a way that ddeb packages get generated.

This works by using ftrace to redirect kernel function calls to the newly patched functions. In addition mechanisms for hooking into module insertion and removal are used for patching loadable modules. This feature also has sysfs directories for tracking which patches are applied and which functions they modify. With the basics aside, this blog post will show some simple examples of how to livepatch your kernel.</description></item><item><title>linux make deb-pkg speedup</title><link>chrisarges.net/posts/2015-07-30-linux-make-deb-pkg-speedup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 15:20:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>chrisarges.net/posts/2015-07-30-linux-make-deb-pkg-speedup/</guid><description>Because I&amp;rsquo;ve run make deb-pkg so many times, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to see exactly where it starts to slow down even with really large machines.

More information can be found in the kernel documentation, but overall there are really a few types of hangs.

Ktest.pl is a script that lives in the linux kernel source tree that helps to automate this process.

I thought of an interesting example of being in the middle of a linux kernel build and a security update needing to be installed and the machine rebooted. While most of us could probably just reboot and rebuild, why not checkpoint it and save the progress; then restore after the system update?</description></item><item><title>manually deploying openstack with a virtual maas on ubuntu trusty (part 2)</title><link>chrisarges.net/posts/2014-06-16-manually-deploying-openstack-with_16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 10:16:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>chrisarges.net/posts/2014-06-16-manually-deploying-openstack-with_16/</guid><description>In the previous post, I went over how to setup a virtual MAAS environment using KVM [1].
