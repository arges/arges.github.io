This post documents how to get a sample patch working.
First, I had to take the patches and apply them against the ubuntu-utopic kernel, which is based on 3.15-rc8 as of this post. They cherry-picked cleanly and the branch I&amp;rsquo;m using is stored here. In addition to applying the patches I had to also enable CONFIG_KGRAFT.</description></item></channel></rss>
