LUKS provides block-layer level encryption, and most modern Linux distros provide easy ways to use and setup keys with the device. The eCryptFS project provides filesystem level encryption which gives a bit more flexibility.
However, many new disks have encryption built-in to the drive&amp;rsquo;s controller and can be interfaced with utilities such as hdparm and sedutil-cli. This built in encryption is called FDE (Full Disk Encryption) or SED (Self Encrypting Drives).</description></item></channel></rss>
